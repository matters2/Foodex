<h1>GA Software Engineering Immersive - Project 2</h1>

<h2>:avocado: Foodex - Weekly Meal Planner :mushroom:</h2>

:cucumber:Intro:
Project requirement is to build a fully functional CRUD web application (both the frontend and backend), which has been built with Ruby, Postgres and the Sinatra framework. This application is to be used as a weekly meal planner and to further provide detailed information about nutrients and ingredients for each meal, which has been obtained through processing requests with an external third-party API 'Edamam'.

:key:Features:
  - Weekly meal planner
  - Search from API recipe database 'Edamam' with over 1.7m recipes
  - Obtain detailed information on ingredients and nutrients for each recipe
  - Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) daily meal selections (breakfast, lunch, dinner) from weekly planner by accessing    SQL database 
  - To be added: total ingredients required for the week for the selected meals.
 
:rocket:Challenges:
The main challenge faced with the project is being able to obtain information from a third party API through HTTP get request, and storing it correctly in the SQL database, so that can it can readily be accessed to update the weekly meal planner when required.

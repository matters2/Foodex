<h1>GA Software Engineering Immersive - Project 2</h1>

<h2>:avocado: Foodex - Meal Planner :mushroom:</h2>

:cucumber:Intro:
Project requirement is to build a CRUD web application (both frontend and backend) that has been built with Ruby, Postgres and the Sinatra framework. This application also is to be used as a weekly meal planner and to provide detailed information through processing requests with an external third-party API Edamam.

:key:Features:
  - Weekly meal planner
  - Search from API recipe database 'Edamam' with over 1.7m recipes
  - Obtain detailed information on ingredients and nutrients for each recipe
  - Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) meal selections from weekly planner by accessing SQL database 
  - To be added total ingredients required for the week for your selected meals.
 
:rocket:Challenges:
The main challenge faced with this project was being able to obtain information from a third party API, and storing it correctly in a database (SQL), that can also be accessed to update the weekly meal planner as required.
